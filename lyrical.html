<!--           <p class="card-text aboutMM">Students around the world are overwhelmed with their futures and are in need of someone to guide them professionally. It is very difficult for these students to find mentors who share similar interests. Sending emails and reaching out to uninterested professors is often ineffective and there are currently only automated mentor apps on the market.This is where MentorMe comes in. MentorMe takes the formula of online dating and puts it in an academic environment to match students and potential mentors. It was created by Julia Connly, Kaila Lee, and Jennifer Chan in the Spring of 2017 and is currently a functional prototype.

      <div class="row">
        <p style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:12pt">The process of redesigning a create and manage scenario of a music playlist began with interivews. Our team conducted 10 in-person interviews which were followed with a walkthrough of a music app of choice. A sample list of interview questions and notes can be seen below.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
          <a href="Interview.png"><img width="100%" src="Interview.png"></a></br>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <p style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:12pt">Once the interviews were finished, our focus turned toward designing the layout for our app. We conducted extensive research on the ways in which other popular music-streaming apps executed their screenflow and user experience. It was important for our team to see what worked and what didn’t work; our comparative analysis of user experience with the UI of different applications was integral to our design decisions.</br></p>

        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-3 mb-3">
          <p style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:12pt">This is an example of a bad layout. We analyzed each individual step of creating a playlist on Spotify. It became clear to us that these five steps are not intuitive and could be redesigned.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <p style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:12pt">Our user testing and personal experience brought us to the realization that users liked having a minimal number of screens that are responsive, intuitive, and can walk them through each step. The less thinking it requires for users to execute specific actions, the more they enjoy using a specific design. As such, we created a flowchart based on the feedback we received.</br></p>

      <div class="row">
        <p style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:12pt"> </br> The flowchart demonstrates the create (top row) and manage (bottom row) scenarios which we found most important. For the create scenario, we designed a way to create a blank playlist from the home page. For the manage scenario, we designed a way to quickly delete a song from an existing playlist. The particular hard decisions within these process are discussed below.</p>

        <p style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:12pt"> </br> <b>Home Screen</b></br></br>
One difficult decision we had was how users would go about navigating through the app. From our research, we noticed that a lot of apps take advantage of a bottom navigation bar that is always present at the footer of the screen, so we wanted to carry that over in our redesign. We wanted a minimal amount of buttons for navigation so we implemented four that are universal, easy to understand, and integral to the functionality of the app. This is why we stuck with Home, My Profile, Search, and My Library. The wording is intentionally personalized and simultaneously direct and clear. We also found the “recently played” feature in many applications valuable for quick and easy access to recent music. Therefore, we ensured that the recently played section is present and clearly labeled on the home page.</p>

        <div class="col-lg-9 mb-9">
        <p style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:12pt"> </br> <b>Create Playlist</b></br></br>
The most difficult decision we made regarding the create playlist revolved around the navigation steps required to make a new playlist. We discovered in our user testing that each app appears to have a different way for the user to create a playlist. In order to make the process faster and intuitive, we placed a “Create Playlist” button on the home page. Once this is clicked, the user inputs the name of the playlist. Another hard decision was the subsequent screen. We determined that the options to search or select a genre both needed to be present. Some users know exactly what music they plan to implement while others would like to browse. We also ensured that the search bar is present on each subsequent “Create Playlist” page in case the user chooses to browse, then wants to search. In this case, the extra step of back navigation is eliminated. Lastly, we recognize that oftentimes a user will add a song unintentionally. Once a song is added, the user is given three options: “Undo”, “Add More”, and “Go to Playlist”. This provides the user with multiple options and makes navigation intuitive.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <p style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:12pt"> </br><b>Manage Playlist</b></br></p>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-2 mb-2">
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-8 mb-8">
        <a href="GoodDelete.png"><img width="100%" src="GoodDelete.png"></a>
      </div>
        <div class="col-lg-2 mb-2">
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
      <p style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:12pt"></br>
Another difficult design was the inclusion of pop up screens versus navigating the user onto a new screen when deleting a playlist. The difficulty behind this design decision was whether it would overwhelm users with so many pages and diving further into the app, thus confusing the user. The upside of this feature would be that it would provide great guidance for the user with clear instruction after every page. However, having too many screens causes much more work on the user to undergo a simple tasks like creating a playlist or managing their music. 
Our team decided to go with the idea of a pop up screen on the current page the user is in. This that would appear with the message we want to communicate to the user. The pop-up screen would disappear by either waiting a short amount of time or by cleaning in the grayed out space. Through this design decision, not only would we portray our apps message across to the user, but we would also simultaneously keep the user on their current page without having the user dive deeper into the app.

      <p style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:12pt"></br>
  Our most difficult design decision was the placement of our “Create Playlist” button. We wanted to make sure that this function was located in a noticeable yet intuitive location. Therefore, we placed the button at the top right of the screen. We also wanted to make sure that the design of the button was consistent across the app. While it’s important that users are able to see the “Create Playlist” function right from our home page, we also wanted to ensure that users could have that options while in “My Library”. However, the location of the button from the “Manage Playlist” screen was another difficult decision. It was hard for us to decide between having the “Create Playlist” button on the top or using the same button we already had from the home screen. Because the space on the header of the screen is small and the icons might not be consistent with the other buttons, we decided on sticking with the same button design from the home screen. In terms of location, we wanted to ensure users would find it at the same location as they would from the home screen.
