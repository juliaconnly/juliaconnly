<!--           <p class="card-text aboutMM">Students around the world are overwhelmed with their futures and are in need of someone to guide them professionally. It is very difficult for these students to find mentors who share similar interests. Sending emails and reaching out to uninterested professors is often ineffective and there are currently only automated mentor apps on the market.This is where MentorMe comes in. MentorMe takes the formula of online dating and puts it in an academic environment to match students and potential mentors. It was created by Julia Connly, Kaila Lee, and Jennifer Chan in the Spring of 2017 and is currently a functional prototype.

      <div class="row">
        <p style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:12pt">Families around the world use cookbooks to share their favorite recipes and pass them down generations. These families need a way to share their favorite recipes with distant relatives and friends. This cookbook was designed for individuals who share an interest in Chinese-American cuisine and allows people to share well-written and visually annotated recipes.</p>

      <div class="row">
        <p style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:12pt">The cookbook was designed using Shutterfly's "advanced editing" design interface. This required importing personalized backgrounds, creating a cusotmized text layouts, and styling imported pictures with corresponding text.</p>

          <p style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:12pt">The most difficult decision involved designing a layout for each page which represented the particular recipes. The Honey-Glazed Walnuts, for example, required many steps in which illustrations were helpful. The column of images with sequenced steps was intentionally designed to improve usability of the cookbook.</p>

          <div class="col-lg-6 mb-6">
          <p style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:12pt"></br>Another difficult decision involves Nielsen's heuristic of consistency. It was important to keep in mind that each recipe required a different amount of images. However, the location of important information such as an overview, cooking time, and servings was purposfeully placed at the top of each recipe page. The font, size, and color of the heading remains consistent across each page. In addition, the overview, cooking time, and servings are consistent in color and location.</p>
